        discord.py is an API wrapper for Discord written in Python.
        
        This was written to allow easier writing of bots or chat logs. Make sure to familiarise yourself with the API using the [documentation][doc].

        ### Breaking Changes
        
        The discord API is constantly changing and the wrapper API is as well. There will be no effort to keep backwards compatibility in versions before `v1.0.0`.
        
        I recommend that you follow the discussion in the [unofficial Discord API discord channel][ch] and update your installation periodically. I will attempt to make note of breaking changes in the API channel so make sure to subscribe to library news by typing `?sub news` in the channel.

        ## Installing
        
        To install the library without full voice support, you can just run the following command:
        
        ```
        python3 -m pip install -U discord.py
        ```
        
        Otherwise to get voice support you should run the following command:
        
        ```
        python3 -m pip install -U discord.py[voice]
        ```
        
        To install the development version, do the following:
        
        ```
        python3 -m pip install -U https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/archive/master.zip#egg=discord.py[voice]
        ```
        
        or the more long winded from cloned source:
        
        ```
        $ git clone https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py
        $ cd discord.py
        $ python3 -m pip install -U .[voice]
        ```
        
        Please note that on Linux installing voice you must install the following packages via your favourite package manager (e.g. `apt`, `yum`, etc) before running the above command:
        
        - libffi-dev (or `libffi-devel` on some systems)
        - python<version>-dev (e.g. `python3.5-dev` for Python 3.5)
        
        ## Quick Example
        
        ```py
        import discord
        import asyncio
        
        client = discord.Client()
        
        @client.event
        async def on_ready():
            print('Logged in as')
            print(client.user.name)
            print(client.user.id)
            print('------')
        
        @client.event
        async def on_message(message):
            if message.content.startswith('!test'):
                counter = 0
                tmp = await client.send_message(message.channel, 'Calculating messages...')
                async for log in client.logs_from(message.channel, limit=100):
                    if log.author == message.author:
                        counter += 1
        
                await client.edit_message(tmp, 'You have {} messages.'.format(counter))
            elif message.content.startswith('!sleep'):
                await asyncio.sleep(5)
                await client.send_message(message.channel, 'Done sleeping')
        
        client.run('token')
        ```
        
        Note that in Python 3.4 you use `@asyncio.coroutine` instead of `async def` and `yield from` instead of `await`.
        
        You can find examples in the examples directory.
        
        ## Requirements
        
        - Python 3.4.2+
        - `aiohttp` library
        - `websockets` library
        - `PyNaCl` library (optional, for voice only)
            - On Linux systems this requires the `libffi` library. You can install in
              debian based systems by doing `sudo apt-get install libffi-dev`.
        
        Usually `pip` will handle these for you.
