        #### Install ###
        
            pip install plexapi
        
        
        #### Getting a PlexServer Instance ####
        
        There are three types of authentication. If running the PlexAPI on the same
        network as the Plex Server (and you are not using Plex Users), you can
        authenticate without a username and password. Getting a PlexServer
        instance is as easy as the following:
        
        ```python
        from plexapi.server import PlexServer
        plex = PlexServer()   # Defaults to localhost:32400
        ```
        
        If you are running on a separate network or using Plex Users you can log
        into MyPlex to get a PlexServer instance. An example of this is below. NOTE:
        Servername below is the name of the server (not the hostname and port).  If
        logged into Plex Web you can see the server name in the top left above your
        available libraries.
        
        ```python
        from plexapi.myplex import MyPlexAccount
        account = MyPlexAccount.signin('<USERNAME>', '<PASSWORD>')
        plex = account.resource('<SERVERNAME>').connect()  # returns a PlexServer instance
        ```
        
        If you want to avoid logging into MyPlex and you already know your auth token
        string, you can use the PlexServer object directly as above, but passing in
        the baseurl and auth token directly.
        
        ```python
        from plexapi.server import MyPlexAccount
        baseurl = 'http://plexserver:32400'
        token = '2ffLuB84dqLswk9skLos'
        plex = PlexServer(baseurl, token)
        ```
        
        
        #### Usage Examples ####
        
        ```python
        # Example 1: List all unwatched content in library.
        for section in plex.library.sections():
            print('Unwatched content in %s:' % section.title)
            for video in section.unwatched():
                print('  %s' % video.title)
        ```
        ```python
        # Example 2: Mark all Conan episodes watched.
        plex.library.get('Conan (2010)').markWatched()
        ```
        ```python
        # Example 3: List all clients connected to the Server.
        for client in plex.clients():
            print(client.name)
        ```
        ```python
        # Example 4: Play the movie Avatar on another client.
        # Note: Client must be on same network as server.
        avatar = plex.library.section('Movies').get('Avatar')
        client = plex.client("Michael's iPhone")
        client.playMedia(avatar)
        ```
        ```python
        # Example 5: List all content with the word 'Game' in the title.
        for video in plex.search('Game'):
            print('%s (%s)' % (video.title, video.TYPE))
        ```
        ```python
        # Example 6: List all movies directed by the same person as Jurassic Park.
        movies = plex.library.section('Movies')
        jurassic_park = movies.get('Jurassic Park')
        director = jurassic_park.directors[0]
        for movie in movies.search(None, director=director):
            print(movie.title)
        ```
        ```python
        # Example 7: List files for the latest episode of Friends.
        thelastone = plex.library.get('Friends').episodes()[-1]
        for part in thelastone.iterParts():
            print(part.file)
        ```
        ```python
        # Example 8: Get a URL to stream a movie or show in another client
        jurassic_park = plex.library.section('Movies').get('Jurassic Park')
        print 'Run running the following command to play in VLC:'
        print 'vlc "%s"' % jurassic_park.getStreamUrl(videoResolution='800x600')
        ```
        
        ```python
        # Example 9: Get audio/video/all playlists
        for playlist in self.plex.playlists():
            print(playlist.title)
        ```
        
        #### FAQs ####
        
        **Q. Why are you using camelCase and not following PEP8 guidelines?**
        
        A. This API reads XML documents provided by MyPlex and the Plex Server.
        We decided to conform to their style so that the API variable names directly
        match with the provided XML documents.
        
        
        **Q. Why don't you offer feature XYZ?**
        
        A. This library is meant to be a wrapper around the XML pages the Plex
        server provides. If we are not providing an API that is offerered in the
        XML pages, please let us know! -- Adding additional features beyond that
        should be done outside the scope of this library.
        
        **Q. What are some helpful links if trying to understand the raw Plex API?**
