        Overview
        --------
        Python bindings for the Plex API. Our goal is to match all capabilities of the official
        Plex Web Client. A few of the many features we currently support are:
        
        * Navigate local or remote shared libraries.
        * Perform library actions such as scan, analyze, empty trash.
        * Remote control and play media on connected clients.
        * Listen in on all Plex Server notifications.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            pip install plexapi
        
        
        Getting a PlexServer Instance
        -----------------------------
        
        There are two types of authentication. If you are running on a separate network
        or using Plex Users you can log into MyPlex to get a PlexServer instance. An
        example of this is below. NOTE: Servername below is the name of the server (not
        the hostname and port).  If logged into Plex Web you can see the server name in
        the top left above your available libraries.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from plexapi.myplex import MyPlexAccount
            account = MyPlexAccount('<USERNAME>', '<PASSWORD>')
            plex = account.resource('<SERVERNAME>').connect()  # returns a PlexServer instance
        
        If you want to avoid logging into MyPlex and you already know your auth token
        string, you can use the PlexServer object directly as above, but passing in
        the baseurl and auth token directly.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from plexapi.server import PlexServer
            baseurl = 'http://plexserver:32400'
            token = '2ffLuB84dqLswk9skLos'
            plex = PlexServer(baseurl, token)
        
        
        Usage Examples
        --------------
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            # Example 1: List all unwatched movies.
            movies = plex.library.section('Movies')
            for video in movies.search(unwatched=True):
                print(video.title)
        
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            # Example 2: Mark all Game of Thrones episodes watched.
            plex.library.section('TV Shows').get('Game of Thrones').markWatched()
        
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            # Example 3: List all clients connected to the Server.
            for client in plex.clients():
                print(client.title)
        
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            # Example 4: Play the movie Cars on another client.
            # Note: Client must be on same network as server.
            cars = plex.library.section('Movies').get('Cars')
            client = plex.client("Michael's iPhone")
            client.playMedia(cars)
        
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            # Example 5: List all content with the word 'Game' in the title.
            for video in plex.search('Game'):
                print('%s (%s)' % (video.title, video.TYPE))
        
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            # Example 6: List all movies directed by the same person as Elephants Dream.
            movies = plex.library.section('Movies')
            die_hard = movies.get('Elephants Dream')
            director = die_hard.directors[0]
            for movie in movies.search(None, director=director):
                print(movie.title)
        
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            # Example 7: List files for the latest episode of The 100.
            last_episode = plex.library.section('TV Shows').get('The 100').episodes()[-1]
            for part in last_episode.iterParts():
                print(part.file)
        
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            # Example 8: Get a URL to stream a movie or show in another client
            die_hard = plex.library.section('Movies').get('Elephants Dream')
            print('Run running the following command to play in VLC:')
            print('vlc "%s"' % die_hard.getStreamURL(videoResolution='800x600'))
        
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            # Example 9: Get audio/video/all playlists
            for playlist in plex.playlists():
                print(playlist.title)
        
        
        Common Questions
        ----------------
        
        **Why are you using camelCase and not following PEP8 guidelines?**
        
        This API reads XML documents provided by MyPlex and the Plex Server.
        We decided to conform to their style so that the API variable names directly
        match with the provided XML documents.
        
        
        **Why don't you offer feature XYZ?**
        
        This library is meant to be a wrapper around the XML pages the Plex
        server provides. If we are not providing an API that is offerered in the
        XML pages, please let us know! -- Adding additional features beyond that
        should be done outside the scope of this library.
        
        
        **What are some helpful links if trying to understand the raw Plex API?**
